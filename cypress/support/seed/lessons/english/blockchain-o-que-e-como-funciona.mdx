## How does it work?

The modern companies have adopted the corporate blockchain to ensure more transparency and security in their operations. They seek a simple and clear definition of this innovative "distributed record" technology to better understand their function and importance.

### What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a technology that allows immutable and real-time transactions and properties. In simple terms, it is a secure and reliable record keeping system that is difficult to be violated, that tracks and identifies the property of assets.

### How does Blockchain Work?

Imagine the blockchain as a database divided into information blocks. These blocks are copied and replicated on multiple computers in the network, all synchronized between them.

When a new transaction is added or modified, all the blocks in the network are updated simultaneously, ensuring that all have a copy of the same and updated.

Each information block is protected by cryptography, making it practically inviolable, similar to the security of online banking portals. The blockchain can store various types of records, such as contracts, writings, logistics manifests, among others, allowing for secure sharing of information in real-time.

### Why is Blockchain Important?

The blockchain is essential for increasing the security of transactions. Each new block of information is added to the end of the chain, with a unique digital signature (or "hash") that is like a coded mathematical secret.

Changing any information in a block that has already been recorded would require the modification of all subsequent blocks in the network, which is almost impossible. This makes the blockchain extremely resistant to hackers.

In addition, the blockchain eliminates intermediaries in transactions, such as lawyers and banks, making the processes more direct and economically efficient. Transactions are validated and executed in a secure and transparent manner, which can reduce costs and increase efficiency.

### Benefits of Blockchain

- **Transparency:** All information in the blockchain is visible to all participants in the network and cannot be changed, which reduces fraud and increases trust.
- **Security:** The distributed and encrypted nature of the blockchain makes it difficult for hackers to act, being promising for cyber security and the Internet of Things (IoT).
- **Less Intermediaries:** The blockchain facilitates direct transactions between parties, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing associated costs.
- **Traceability:** As records are immutable, the blockchain is ideal for tracing the origin of products in complex supply chains.
- **Efficiency and ROI:** Automation of processes and the elimination of intermediaries accelerate the return on investment (ROI) and increase operational efficiency.
- **Automation:** With smart contracts, the blockchain can automate the execution of agreements when certain conditions are met, reducing time and effort required for manual execution.
- **Privacy of Data:** Although information is verified publicly, data is protected by cryptography, ensuring privacy.

### Types of Blockchain Networks

There are four main types of blockchain networks:

1. **Public:** Open access to everyone, such as the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum.
2. **Semi-private:** Controlled by a single company that grants access to qualified users.
3. **Private:** Completely controlled by an organization, used for specific purposes within the company.
4. **Consortium:** Controlled by a group of organizations, are the most used in corporate environments.

### Use Cases

The blockchain is being used in various sectors, from supply chain to the public sector and financial services.

For example:

- **Supply Chain:** Traces and verifies the authenticity of products, from origin to final consumer.
- **Public Sector:** Used for official records of assets, such as real estate and vehicles, in addition to facilitating electoral processes and improving government transparency.
- **Public Services:** Applied in sales of solar energy between neighbors and energy exchange between large companies.
- **Human Resources:** Verifies and validates qualifications and employment histories of candidates quickly and securely.
- **Finances:** Simplifies contingency and financial transactions, ensuring more security and efficiency.

### Conclusion

The blockchain is like a large digital book of records, where all transactions are recorded securely and transparently. Each record is protected by cryptography and distributed between multiple computers, making it difficult for someone to alter the information.

This brings more security and trust to the operations of companies, eliminating the need for intermediaries and allowing processes to be faster and more cost-effective.

The blockchain is being used in various areas, from tracking products to ensuring the authenticity of documents and facilitating financial transactions. It is a technology that is changing the way businesses and governments operate, making everything more efficient and secure.
